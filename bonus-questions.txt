Question:
Explain why the result of ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() is banana.

Answer:
the expression indicates that all strings encapsulated with the '' would be conactenated together to form a complete word, 
however "++" is not a valid string and would return "Nan" which would then be made lowercase with the .toLowerCase() function. 

Essentially it would run as demonstrated:

1. 
'b' + 'a' = ba 
because 'b' and 'a' are simply strings

2. + 'a'
+ is a urnary operator which is trying to add the string 'a'
however since 'a' is not a number it returns Nan returning now as baNan

3. Nan + 'a'
Nan and 'a' simple concatenate to create the final word: banana

4. toLowerCase()
thanks to this function the Nan can be made lowercase this making the word coherent
final result: banana
